# MCMC_Compliance

MCMC_Compliance is an open-source Python package designed for Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inversion of seafloor compliance. It also supports the joint inversion of seafloor compliance and other ocean-bottom seismometer (OBS) enabled observables such as Ps converted wave delays.
